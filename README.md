The AI Career Coach is an AI-powered platform that provides personalized career guidance to students and professionals. It is designed to simplify the career journey by integrating intelligent recommendations, interactive tools, and supportive resources, all within a seamless workflow.

The platform begins with user sign-up and an Industry Insights Form to gather preferences and goals. Based on this input, users access a personalized Insights Dashboard featuring a roadmap tailored to their current skills and desired career path. This roadmap helps users identify skill gaps and plan actionable steps toward their goals.

Leveraging the Gemini API, the system generates personalized role recommendations aligned with industry trends and the user’s profile. From here, users can access a suite of specialized modules designed to enhance their employability:
